10.1 Authentication

- Access Control
    - Identification
    - Authentica
    - Authorization
    - Accounting
- Single Sign On & Kerberos
    - Single Sign On: Allows user to authenticate once to a local device and be authorized to access compatible servers
    - Kerberso provides SSO Authentication to Active Directory
- Digital Certificates & PKI
    - Protocol such as Kerberos can be used with smart cards
- Key Management
    - Key Generation
    - Storage
    - Revocation
    - Expiration & Renewal
- Federated Identity and SAML
  - Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertions are written in XML 
    - Implement in AWS
- Remote Authentication 
  - Remote Authentication Dial-In USer Service (RADIUS) is used widely: VPN to Client Access
  - TACACS+: Rarely used in enterprise

10.2 Authorization and Account Management 
  1.4 Explain common networkingn prots, protocols, services, and traffic types
  4.1 Explain the importance of basic security concepts

- Authoriation and Role Based Access Control 
  - Discretionary Access Control (DAC): Primacy of the resource owner
  - RBAC: Organization defines its authenoraiotns in terms of the taskt that na employee or service must be able to perform. 
    - Administrators should be prevented to escalating their own priveleges
  - Priveleged Access Management
    - Least Privelege: User is granted sufficient rights to perform their job and no more
