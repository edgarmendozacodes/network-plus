12.1 Wireless Concepts and Standards

- IEEE 802.11 Wireless Standards â†’ Wi-Fi
    - Uses Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)
- IEEE 802.11a and 5GHz Channel Bandwidth
    - Frequency Band and Channels
        - 2.4 GHz is better through solid surfaces
        - 5 Ghz is better for higher data rates at shorter ranges and not through solid surfaces
- IEEE 8021b/g and 2.4 GHz Channel Bandwidth
- IEEE 802.11n, MIMO, and Channel Bonding
